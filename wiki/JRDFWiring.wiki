#summary Ways to wire up JRDF and entry points

= JRDF and IoC =
Use of inversion of control (IoC) is used to decouple the various dependencies in JRDF.  The use of Spring (2.0.1) is used in the JRDF GUI and in testing.

== Using Spring ==
Spring is a popular IoC container.  Using Spring for JRDF is to allow:
  * Easier testing that comes with the use of inversion of control,
  * The ability to switch in different implementations (such as different implementations of query operations such as OPTIONAL),
  * The use of existing Spring libraries and extensions.  This includes declarative transactions, JPA, Aspects, Spring Rich Client, and AOP.
  * Allows integration into other Spring enabled projects.

The creation of object through the container is often called wiring.  JRDF comes with a XML configuration file (wiring.xml) that defines the creation of various objects.  This includes the lifecycle of the bean and whether the a bean is a singleton (only one instance) or a prototype (instances created new every time).  Spring 2.0 provides a new, custom scope, which allows scopes to be tied to a thread or HTTP session.

However, it is clear the Spring and containers are a rather large requirement for most projects.  With this in mind the use of IoC has been limited.

== Without Spring ==
The use of IoC can be taken to the finest level, where each object is created through the container and constructors are never used.  This finest level of control has two main drawbacks:
  * It is not clear through the list of bean wiring exactly the order in which bean are created or rather what objects are at the top of the depency tree.
  * That no objects can be created without an IoC framework.

In order to find a balance between wiring everything and wiring very few things entry points have been defined to allow the user of a system determine not only how to use JRDF without an IoC container but it also reduces the complexity in determining what to wire up if a container is already being used.

= Entry Points =
In order to use JRDF it must be obvious where to start - that is what are the first objects that need to be created.  This has to be available and clear even if a wiring framework, such as Spring, is not available.

JRDF has two entry points: Graph and SPARQL connection.

== JRDF Graph ==

The JRDF Graph API supports pluggable storage through the LongIndex and NodePool interfaces and the ability to produce results from simple graph queries that are sorted or unsorted.  An a third interface, NodePoolComparator, is an optional third interface required by sorted graphs.

=== Implementations of LongIndex and NodePool ===

There is currently in memory interfaces for both LongIndex and NodePool interfaces.  JRDF requires three long indexes (in order to index each combination of triples which is through the GraphHandler interface 012, 120 and 201).  To create these implementations the following code is required:
{{{
LongIndex[] indexes = new LongIndex[]{new LongIndexMem(), new LongIndexMem(), new LongIndexMem()};
NodePoolMem nodePool = new NodePoolMemImpl();
}}}

=== Constructing GraphFactories ===

The GraphFactory interface has two implementations GraphFactoryImpl (unsorted results returned) and OrderedGraphFactoryImpl (sorted results returned).

To construct an unsorted GraphFactory the following code is required:
{{{
GraphFactory orderedGraphFactory = new GraphFactoryImpl(indexes, nodePool);
}}}

To construct a sorted GraphFactory:
{{{
NodeTypeComparator nodeTypeComparator = new NodeTypeComparatorImpl();
NodeComparator comparator = new NodeComparatorImpl(NODE_TYPE_COMPARATOR);
GraphFactory orderedGraphFactory = new OrderedGraphFactoryImpl(indexes, nodePool, comparator);
}}}

== SPARQL Connection ==
