#summary Ways to wire up JRDF and entry points

= JRDF and IoC =
Use of inversion of control (IoC) is used to decouple the various dependencies in JRDF.  The use of Spring (2.0.1) is used in the JRDF GUI and in testing.

== Using Spring ==
Spring is a popular IoC container.  Using Spring for JRDF is to allow:
  * Easier testing that comes with the use of inversion of control,
  * The ability to switch in different implementations (such as different implementations of query operations such as OPTIONAL),
  * The use of existing Spring libraries and extensions.  This includes declarative transactions, JPA, Aspects, Spring Rich Client, and AOP.
  * Allows integration into other Spring enabled projects.

However, it is clear the Spring and containers are a rather large requirement for most projects.  With this in mind the use of IoC has been limited.

== Without Spring ==
= Entry Points =
In order to use JRDF it must be obvious where to start - that is what are the first objects that need to be created.  This has to be available and clear even if a wiring framework, such as Spring, is not available.
