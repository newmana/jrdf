#summary Local and Distributed Querying of JRDF

= Local and Distributed Querying of JRDF =

The server component of JRDF provides a way to expose graphs for remote querying using RESTful model.

= Starting a Single Servers =
To start a single local server run the SpringLocalServer Java application.  This can be done by running:
{{{
java -jar jrdf-server-0.5.5.5.jar
}}}

The server can be view by going to port 8182 on the local machine:
{{{
http://localhost:8182/graphs
}}}

This will show a list of graphs on the current machine - which will typically be empty on initialization.

To create a new graph simply go to the URI of the graph you wish to query, for example graph "foo" will be created when you go to "http://localhost:8182/graphs/foo".  Using a web browser, you will be presented by a HTML presentation of the resource - which is a form to allow you to submit queries to the graph.

Queries can be submitted by GETting a encoded SPARQL query.  For example, the SPARQL query:
{{{
SELECT *
WHERE {
    ?s ?p ?o .
}
}}}

Is equivalent to:
{{{
http://localhost:8182/graphs/foo/?query=SELECT+*%0D%0AWHERE+{%0D%0A++++%3Fs+%3Fp+%3Fo+.%0D%0A}%0D%0A++++
}}}

You can override the format of the query by submitting a query parameter called "format", for example:
{{{
http://localhost:8182/graphs/foo/?query=SELECT+*%0D%0AWHERE+{%0D%0A++++%3Fs+%3Fp+%3Fo+.%0D%0A}%0D%0A++++&format=html
}}}

The current representation supported are XML and HTML with JSON to follow.
