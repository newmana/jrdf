= JRDF's Graph Interface =

== Nodes ==

JRDF's model of RDF nodes uses a hierarchy of interfaces.  At the top of the class hierarchy is the Node.  This is subclassed by positional nodes: Subject, Predicate and Object.  These are then further subclasses by the appropriate typed nodes: bnode (blank node), URI and Literal.
