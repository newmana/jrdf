#summary Storing and loading graphs in JRDF.

= Persistent JRDF Graphs =

JRDF has evolved to support basic persistence of graphs.  Graphs can be created using the PersistentJRDFFactoryImpl.  This requires a DirectoryHandler in order to be created.

= Directory Handler =
The DirectoryHandler interface is designed to manage the location where the indexes and system graph is stored.  It is used by the persistent graph factories.

Currently, there is only one DirectoryHandler implementation called TempDirectoryHandler.  it uses the current user name and system temporary directory property ("java.io.tmpdir") to create a directory.  For example, with a username of "andrew" on Windows it creates a "C:\temp\jrdf_andrew" directory.
