#summary Notes on using the Java BDB implementation.

= Using Java BDB in JRDF =

Currently, one of the implementations used to store triples in JRDF is BDB.  It has its own set of idioms to be aware of when being used.

== Creating a new MapFactory ==
Unlike the in memory map factory the BDB MapFactory is tied to a BDB Environment which must be carefully managed.

If you wish to use a the MapFactory outside of the JRDF Graph Factory the way to construct a map factory is as follows:
{{{
// Create a new directory that implements the DirectoryHandler interface.
// Do no use the TempDirHandler (this is for the JRDF's use only)
DirHandler dirHandler = new DirHandler();
BdbEnvironmentHandler envHanlder = new BdbEnvironmentHandlerImpl(dirHandler);
// Ensure that the database name, the second entry, is unique
MapFactory mapFactory = new BdbMapFactory(handler, "seqDB");
}}}

If you wish to cleanup (delete directories and remove memory used) ensure to call close on the mapFactory:
{{{
mapFactory.close();
dirHandler.removeDir();
}}}
