#summary The use and algorithms of Global RDF Graphs.

= Global Graphs =

Global Graphs contrast with [GettingStarted local graphs] in that they do not require a node pool and unique identifiers for graph nodes.  This means that nodes can be used in a distributed environment.

= RDF Molecules =
RDF molecules represent a lossless decomposition of an RDF graph.  The main purpose of molecules is to allow blank nodes to be distributed without loss of information or context.  The context in an RDF molecule allows node ids in blank nodes to be discarded and blank nodes are equal or unequal based on the context within an RDF molecule.

The structure of an RDF molecule is a recursive structure - RDF molecules contain other RDF molecules through linking triples.  For example, a set of triples:
{{{
{_:1  observedInteraction _:2}
{_:1 type ExperimentalObservation}
{_:2 participant _:3}
{_:3 hasUniprotID ‘p32379’}
{_:2 participant _:4}
{_:4 hasUniprotID ‘p46949’}
}}}

Can be represented in an RDF molecule as:
{{{
{_ type ExperimentalObservation}
{_  observedInteraction _}
  {_ participant _}
    {_ hasUniprotID ‘p32379’}
  {_ participant _}
    {_ hasUniprotID ‘p46949’}
}}}

Where the first level of the molecule contains 2 triples (or root triples), the second level contains 2 triples and each of the 3rd levels contains another triple.  Triples with two blank nodes are know as link triples.

RDF molecules are also ordered.  For two nodes the ordering is determined by the following rules:
  * Subject, predicate and object nodes in a triple are compared with each other.
  * Node Type
    * Blank node type, is less than;
    * URI Reference node type, is less than;
    * Literal node type.
  * Node Value
    * Comparison of string value based on N3 serialization.

For example: s p o > `_` p o > `_` p `_`

Triples that contain at least one blank node are known as "ungrounded triples".  Triples that contain no blank nodes are "grounded triples".  The "root triples" of a molecule are the first level triples.  A "link triple" is a triple that contains two blank nodes (as the subject and object).  A "head triple" is the first triple in a molecule as defined by the above ordering.

As most RDF data will already be in local RDF format we need a way to decompose RDF graphs into molecules.  This process can also be used to remove redundant RDF triples and so produce a lean RDF graph. 

= Creating a Global Graph from a Local Graph =
The current algorithm in creating a global graph from a local graph has three steps:
  * A graph is decomposed into molecules,
  * An equivalence blank node map (mapping local blank nodes to other local blank nodes) is created between molecules,
  * Molecules are merged together using the blank node map.
